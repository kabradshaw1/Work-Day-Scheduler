## Usage

You can type in activities into the grey section.  The blue button off to the right is the save button.  When you press that button, it will move the information in the grey box to local storage, where it will presist when you return to the page or refresh the page.

The bootcamp team provided some starter html and the css from their example. I believe the starter code was just an html 5 with a couple libraries attacked, and a div element added. I don't think I was actually able to figure out what they wanted me to do with 90% of the css, so I mostly used bootstrap and css I created.
